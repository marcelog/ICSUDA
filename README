I made this software a long time ago. It's here because of nostalgic reasons. It works, but dont take it too seriously since it hasn't been tested like it should be :D I've come a long way since this code, but it can still be used to learn some stuff if you're new to the Java world.

You'll need a mysql database as a storage backend for offline messages and user information.

I haven't tried to compile this under new Java versions. I think I made this with Java 1.2, so you've been warned..
